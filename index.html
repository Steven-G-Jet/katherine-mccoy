						Born in Decatur, Illinois, 1945, Katherine discovered design on a family trip to the New York Museum of Modern Art. There, she learned about the Bauhaus movement, which planted the seed of design in her heart. In 1967, she satisfyingly graduated with a degree in industrial design from Michigan State University.

						<h2>A DESIGN PRACTITIONER</h2>
						<p>After graduation, she started her career by working in nationally renowned design agencies, such as Unimark International, Omnigraphics and Design & Partners. There, she met designers who influenced her philosophies on design and encouraged her to find her style.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Unimark International</h3>
						<p>She began her career with Unimark International, a graphic design firm headed by Swiss style masters such as Herbert Bayer, Mildred Constantine, Massimo Vignelli and Jay Doblin. She was surrounded by Swiss style typography, and the training became the basis of her understanding of typography, and the corner stone for her future exploration in graphic and information design. In her spare time, she avidly read books written by Josef Muller-Brockman, Karl Gerstner and Armin Hoffman. Following the rigorous rules imposed by Massimo Vignelli, Katherine faithfully created the Swiss style design for American corporations.</p>

						<h3>Omnigraphics</h3>
						<p>Shortly after leaving Unimark International, Katherine went to work for Omnigraphics, an advertising agency in Boston. There, she had the opportunity to work on projects with MIT Press and another design guru of the time, Muriel Cooper. Muriel Cooper was a pioneer in information design and a pioneer of information architecture. Muriel’s interest in the subject influenced Katherine, inspiring to do more work in the area.</p>

						<h3>Design & Partners</h3>
						<p>While working at Design & Partners, another advertising agency, Katherine met Edward Fella, a designer known for his idiosyncratic collage and stylized typography. Katherine was fascinated by his work, and was inspired by the expressive design he made. His sketchy, doodle-like, fun handwritten typefaces inspired Katherine to explore design styles that are beyond Swiss design.</p>

						<h2>A DESIGN EDUCATOR</h2>
						<p>From 1971 to 1995, Katherine was appointed as the head of 2D design program in Cranbrook Academy of Art. In the span of 24 years, she made her most influences and notable works in the design community. 
						</p>

						<h3 id="Subtitle">Post-modernism Experiment</h3>
						<p>After coming to Cranbrook, she experimented with various expressive means to communicate through graphic design other than Swiss style or Modernism, which she found rather limiting. She openly rejected their sterile,“scientifically predictable transmission of meaning”01, and she encouraged her students to conduct design experiments that expanded design vocabulary. In many ways, her evolution in design philosophy and that of Cranbrook’s design are very similar. Both started with Bauhaus philosophy, and slowly transcended in search of graphic design approaches that more richly communicate ideas</p>

        		<p>Katherine looked to linguistics and literary theories for inspiration. She was greatly influenced by semiotics, or the study of signs and their meanings. It is consisted of three parts: semantics (the meaning of symbols), pragmatics(the structural relationship between signs), and syntactics(the relationship between sign carrier / agents and their environment). She believes that properly composing the three elements will produce a piece of information rich in meaning.</p>

				<p>She believes that design is a language. Its vocabulary consists of forms, graphics and colors. For her, Swiss style is a language that has a small vocabulary. Thus, she believes it is necessary to bring back graphic elements that have been sterilely stripped away: the ornamental, stylistic, vernacular design. The vernacular elements, a pop art photo for example, are especially accentuated by Katherine since it helps audience understand the context. To use the information from vernacular elements to enrich the communications inspires reactions from the audiences.</p>
				<p>
					The evolution of Katherine’s experiments are reflected in the works her students produce. As years go on, her students have begun to employ more expressive rhetoric devices to deliver their messages, such as analogies and metaphors. The layers students add in their </p>
        		</div>
        		
        		<div class="col span_4_of_12">

					 <p>pieces have become more intricate and well composed, inviting their audiences to interpret their designs in more ways, opening up more conversations. Katherine’s philosophy has also been adopted by students from other design disciplines. The furniture design students have started to experiment with semiotics by exploring the relationship between furniture, figure and space. They aim to use the form of their furniture to convey not only what it is but also what it means in their users’ lives.</p>
					
					<p>
					When Katherine published her student’s works, the design world responded with great passion. Some condemned her work, and some praised her efforts. Massimo Vignelli commented: “Cranbrook Academy of Art is the most dangerous school in the world”01. Designing based off theories has little practical uses but they spark designers to think about what is next for the design world. Katherine realized the importance of spreading her sparks and started publishing her experiments. Through her writing, she became a distinctive voice in the design community, feeding new ideas to others. Soon, many designers resonated with her thinking. Slowly, she was recognized as a leader of a new movement, Post-Modernism.</p>

					<h2>CURRENT WORKS</h2>
					<p>In 2004, Katherine and her husband semi-retired to a resort in Colorado. In their studio homes, they held workshops for professional designers both to inspire and provoke conversations on the current design subjects. Katherine also took up a personal project to study the life of Herbert Bayer, a designer she admired and believe to be undermentioned.
